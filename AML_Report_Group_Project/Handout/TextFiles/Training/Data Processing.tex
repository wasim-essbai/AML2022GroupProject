\subsection{Data Processing}

Before training the model, a simple pre-processing phase is done. This consists in the conversion of images from 4-channel to grey scale. The main reason is make the training process faster.

Furthermore, the labels are converted from integer values to float, for compatiblity reasons. The labels are also scaled by a factor of 1000000, to get more margin between each code.
